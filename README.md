# deep-learning-code-packs
Custom deep learning codes to perform common tasks.

1. [learner_custom_module ](learner_custom_module)
This contains a fastai style learner class which can train and predict given dataloaders as input. It is a work in progress. Currently plots, losses, model reset and many small details have been added.  
further work:  
  * model checkpoint for test
  * layer by layer training for TF
  * visualisation(like gradcam)
  * lr scheduler
